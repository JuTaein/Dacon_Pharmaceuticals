Development of a Prediction Model for CYP3A4 Enzyme Inhibition in Human Drug Metabolism

- A prediction model was developed using a training dataset of 1,681 compounds, which includes their chemical structures and CYP3A4 enzyme inhibition rates (% inhibition). The model will be used to predict inhibition rates for a competition's evaluation dataset.

- train data: 1,681 compounds related to CYP3A4 enzyme inhibition.
    - ID: Unique identifier
    - Canonical_Smiles: Molecular structure data
    - Inhibition: Inhibition rate (unit: %)
